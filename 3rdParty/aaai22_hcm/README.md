    - Require R >= 3.6.3
    - Run following code in the R Console
    
    ```install.packages("/ossfs/workspace/pai-algo-dev/momentchi2_0.1.5.tar", repos=NULL, type="source")```
 
2. Install required python packages

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Run example
- run.py provides an example for you to conduct one experiment and one can refer to const.py to learn the meaning of parameters.
